### 1. Description
We build a system that can identify patient's condition by the help of both `Natural Language Processing(NLP)` and `Machine Learning(ML)` in classifying patient to reduce the efforts and time expanded by the doctors and evaluate the type of patient at an early stage.

### 2. Dataset
The datset is collected from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29).

### 3. EDA - Exploratory data analysis
      * Statisticaly analysis data

### 4. Data Preprocessing 
1. Sopt Word
2. Lemmatization
3. Split the dataset
    * Split the dataset with `80%` of `training set` and `20%` of `test set`.
4. Creating features and Target Variable

### 4. Model
1. `TF-IDF` - TF-IDF is a very popular feature extraction technique. Text needs to converted into vector or matrix before fed them to the Machine Learning model.
2. `Bag of Words`
3. `Naive Bayes`
4. `Passive Aggressive Classifier`
 
### 5. Evaluation
1. `Confusion Matrix`
2. `Accuracy`
